Hi, I'm Francesco! A web developer from Italy with a penchant for service design and productivity hacks.

After 5 years of agency experience and 2 years as freelancer (design, frontend, syadmin), I decided to take up the challenge to shift to the backend, learning Ruby and the Rails framework. And I'm super loving it!

Movie snob, typography lover, and UX enthusiast. I love designing things that really help people in their everyday life.

Iâ€™m a fan of the GTD principles and the Rework manifesto. I strongly believe in transparency, simplicity, and purpose.

Oh, btw... Currently looking for a Ruby internship in Berlin! ðŸ˜Š
