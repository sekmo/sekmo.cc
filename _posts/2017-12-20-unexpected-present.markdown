The most beautiful Christmas present arrived in advance: ðŸŽ‰I-GOT-THE-JOB!!!ðŸŽ‰

For the initial couple of minutes I couldn't decipher the actual
intention of the phone call, because the guy prepared it in a tricky way ðŸ˜ƒ - It's been a real emotional rollercoaster!!! ðŸ˜±

After I hang up, 3 seconds of cosmic void, then I obviously shouted all over the apartment.
Having been planned it for almost a year, it's getting real!
