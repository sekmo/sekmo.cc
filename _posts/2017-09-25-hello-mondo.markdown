I finally set up a working blog where I'll throw some random things I'm doing, watching or thinking. Yay!!! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

Since at the moment I'm mostly focused on Ruby and Rails I'll probably share stuff about it, as well as personal thoughts, productivity tricks, or nice places that I discover when walking around.

This website runs on Jekyll and is being hosted on Digital Ocean.
I decided to switch from php-based solutions to the Ruby ecosystem for its commitment to code quality, in addition to its stability and the really awesome community that was built around it.<br>Yep, I like keeping up with new technologies and trying new things (especially when I'm eating out), but I tend to prefer battle-tested tools that do their job rather than new shiny stuff.

It goes hand in hand to what I think about technology: it should be useful and efficient indeed, but when it's not decently usable or the time we spend turning knobs is more than the time it saves us, then it's not technology anymore.
