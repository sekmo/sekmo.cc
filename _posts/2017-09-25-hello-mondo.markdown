Welcome to my brand new website! ðŸŽ‰<br>This section comes from my wish to give back to the blog community: without all the free resources we're able to find on blogs and websites, this world would be a much poorer place.

Since at the moment Iâ€™m mostly focused on Ruby and Rails Iâ€™ll probably share quick notes about those, as well as personal thoughts, productivity tricks, and nice places that I discover when walking around.

This website runs on Jekyll and is being hosted on Digital Ocean. I decided to switch from php-based solutions to the Ruby ecosystem for its commitment to code quality, as well as its stability and the really awesome community that has built up around it.
Yep, I like keeping up with new technologies and trying new things (especially when Iâ€™m eating out), but I prefer battle-tested tools that do their job rather than new shiny stuff.

This goes hand-in-hand with my philosophy on technology: our tools should be useful and efficient, and if by using them we waste more time turning knobs than we save, then itâ€™s not technology anymore.
