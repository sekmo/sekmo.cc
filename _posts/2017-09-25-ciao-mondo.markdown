After literally years, I finally set up a working website where I throw some random stuff I'm doing, watching or thinking.

I'll probably share stuff about Rails 














{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
